In adapting to English the /Méthode Sténographie Duployé/ I have endeavoured to retain the admirable simplicity which characterizes both its principles and outlines.

Duployan Shorthand being in such a general use upon the Continent, an adaption of it to English, such, that every sound common to the two languages is represented by the same sign, will at once commend itself to those engaged in commercial correspondence. To a student, the Duployan system offers a unique advantage since it puts within his reach reading matter stenographically represented and therefore with true sound values, in at least ten languages, /inter alia/, German, Italian, French, Portuguese, Turkish, etc.

The system has a large and varied literature and also several newspapers and journals. It has met with remarkable success as an educational factor in elementary schools, which is owing in part, to the fact that it is not burdensome to the memory, as it does not call into its service any of the multitude of bewildering devices such as thickening, lengthening, raising above the line, etc., to add new sounds, or disconnected vowels or worse still the discarding of vowels. In this system every sound is represented so clearly that the transcribing, and even fluent reading of it, is an easy matter.

In the first part a system is offered that will enable any one of average intelligence to write from three to four times as fast as in longhand. I have endeavoured to place within the reach of “the many” a system that, to use a popular phrase, supplies a long felt want, that is to say, a system written and learnt with ease, and, most important of all, capable of being read with ease.

In shorthand examinations the marks for transcription are on an average five times as many as are given for the shorthand. If then for the sake of legibility some little advantage in speed has been sacrificed this will be more than atoned for by the ease with which the pupil will read his notes.

In the second and third part there is explained, for those whose goal is the reporters table, a complete system of abbreviated shorthand.

Part II deals with all common prefixes and suffixes abbreviated forms of common words, together with a novel and simple method of representing the auxiliary verbs. Part III, in a few pages expounds our completed system.

I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the Rev. D.H. Thompson [Stonyhurst] for the help he has given me in framing this adaptation. If it meets with any success it will be owing to my collaborateur’s suggestions.

* The Phonetic Principle
:properties:
:unnumbered: t
:end:
The letters of the Alphabet serve to indicate not only the sounds of the language but also the etymological differences, the variations of pronunciation, and the exigencies of grammar. Consequently we find that certain letters under varying circumstances, assume the characteristic sounds of other letters. In stenography this cannot happen, for, to each and every sound we have given a sign, which unvaryingly represents that one sound only.

To write phonetically, then, all that is required of us is to catch the sounds uttered and represent them by the signs of the stenographic alphabet, paying no attention to the variations of orthography.

In the word /high/ there are four letters but only two sounds, and these two sounds alone, viz, the aspirate and the diphthong, claim the stenographers attention. There are seven letter in the word /through/ to express three sounds; phonography confines itself to the three sounds.

In ordinary writing the sound /uh/ as in /nut/ is represented by different letters in each of the following words: /much/, /love/, /circle/, /pearl/, /sermon/, /pillar/, /courage/, /blood/. Now in phonography one sign is used for this sound. Again, the pronunciation which we give to the letter /i/ in the alphabet, i.e. the sound it has in /fine/, it altogether different in /fin/ and /first/, Phonography recognizes here three distinct sounds and to each of them allots a sign.

The combination /ch/ has a different rendering in each of the following words /cheap/, /chaise/, /schism/, /scheme/. Phonetically their values are ch-ee-p, sh-ai-z, s-i-s-m, s-k-ee-m.

We distinguish also the varying sounds of /t/ in the following words: /net/, /nation/, /feature/, /hasten/.

These few examples are sufficient to illustrate what we mean by the phonetic principle. There is no need for us to discuss its utility.

We conclude these few fore-words by calling the pupil’s attention to an essential point in our phonetics. Stenographic signs represent sounds. Now, the names of the consonants of our ordinary alphabet are Bee, eF, Gee, eM, eL, ahRe, etc. in other words they have in the majority of cases a sound very different from that which they have in words – for example – /church/ spelt out is: /see-aitch-eu-ahre-see-aitch/. Analyzing the sounds of the word we find that there are but four sounds. Take the first part of the word, viz, /ch/, pronounce it slowly, the sound given is that of the two consonants followed by a short sharp /e/ or /uh/ sound; similarly the final /ch/. It will be found that all other consonants are sounded after this manner. Take for example the /s/ and /p/ in /sermon/ and /person/; they are not /eS/, /Pee/ but /suh/, /puh/, or /se/, /pe/. The consonants in our phonetic alphabet are therefore sounded /Be/, /Fe/, /Le/, /Me/, /Re/, /Te/, etc. or /Buh/, /Fuh/, /Luh/, /Muh/, /Ruh/, /Tuh/, etc. This is of great importance and must always be borne in mind.

If therefore a syllable is formed by this obscure vowel sound added to a consonant, it will be indicated by the consonant sign alone. Thus we phonetically represent the following words /much/, /love/, /pearl/, /cousin/, in this way: M[uh]-CH, L[uh]-V, P[uh]-R-L, K[uh]-S-N.

If however the “uh” is accentuated it may then be indicated by its vowel sign. The vowel “uh” in the beginning of such words as earl, earnest, etc. must be shown.

Any want of clearness in the above explanation will be dispelled by noting the application of it in the following lessons to the numerous examples given.

** Lesson 1
The signs of this System are formed from the two simplest of geometrical figures, namely the Straight Line and the Circle.

The straight line both full length and half length takes the following directions indicated by the arrow: [[file:img/fig1-1.png]]

A large and small circle are used, the latter being about half the size of the former: [[file:img/fig1-2.png]]

These circles are now divided first by a line drawn through them Vertically [[file:img/fig1-3.png]] thereby giving us these four signs: [[file:img/fig1-4.png]]. Next by a line dividing them Horizontally [[file:img/fig1-5.png]] and giving us the following signs: [[file:img/fig1-6.png]] i.e. [[file:img/fig1-7.png]]. And lastly, the circles are cut into quadrants: [[file:img/fig1-8.png]] = [[file:img/fig1-9.png]] = [[file:img/fig1-10.png]]

The following supplementary signs, chiefly used as diacritical or distinguishing marks, are also made use of: a dot [[file:img/fig1-11.png]], a dash [[file:img/fig1-12.png]], and the acute [[file:img/fig1-13.png]], and grave [[file:img/fig1-14.png]] accents.

*** The Consonants formed from the Straight line

| [[file:img/fig1-15.png]] | Be [[file:img/fig1-16.png]] | Pe [[file:img/fig1-17.png]] | drawn straight downwards           |
| [[file:img/fig1-18.png]] | De [[file:img/fig1-19.png]] | Te [[file:img/fig1-20.png]] | drawn from left to right           |
| [[file:img/fig1-21.png]] | Ge [[file:img/fig1-22.png]] | Ke [[file:img/fig1-23.png]] | drawn obliquely from right to left |
| [[file:img/fig1-24.png]] | Ve [[file:img/fig1-25.png]] | Fe [[file:img/fig1-26.png]] | drawn obliquely from left to right |
| [[file:img/fig1-27.png]] | Re [[file:img/fig1-28.png]] | Le [[file:img/fig1-29.png]] | drawn upwards from left to right   |
Observe that the soft and longer sounds Be, De, Ge, Ve are expressed by the longer lines whilst their corresponding hard and shorter sounds Pe, Te, Ke, Fe are expressed by the shorter ones.

The consonant Re has two distinct shades of sound, one hard or trill-sound as in /broil/, /zeal/, /umbrella/; the other is a soft and frequently barely audible sound as in /door/, /fear/, /heart/, this latter may be distinguished from the former by a dash written in the middle of the sign: [[file:img/fig1-30.png]].

*** The Consonants formed from the Semi-circles

| Se [[file:img/fig1-31.png]]  | Ze [[file:img/fig1-32.png]]                            | drawn from left to right | [[file:img/fig1-33.png]] |
| She [[file:img/fig1-34.png]] | Zhe [[file:img/fig1-35.png]]                           | drawn from left to right | [[file:img/fig1-36.png]] |
| Me [[file:img/fig1-37.png]]  | Ne [[file:img/fig1-38.png]] & GNe [[file:img/fig1-39.png]] | drawn downwards          | [[file:img/fig1-40.png]] |
It will be noticed that the soft sounds Ze and Zhe as in /zeal/, /as/, /vision/, are distinguished from their corresponding hard sounds by a dot. The difference between the two nasals Ne and GNe is also indicated by a dot.

*** The Consonants GHe Je THe hard THe soft
The true sound-value of the consonant GHe is found in the words /church/, /chariot/, /chess/, etc.

The corresponding soft sound is Je as in /jerk/, /giant/, /jest/, etc. GHe is formed from two quadrants of a small circle [[file:img/fig1-41.png]] written in the same direction as the sign for Ke viz [[file:img/fig1-42.png]].

Je is written the same way but two quadrants of a large circle are used viz [[file:img/fig1-43.png]].

Since THe is a blending of the sounds of Te and De, we write its equivalent phonetic character which is formed from two quadrants of a circle joined together, in the same direction as Te and De viz [[file:img/fig1-44.png]] i.e. [[file:img/fig1-45.png]].

The soft sound as in *There* is written full length [[file:img/fig1-46.png]].

The hard sound as in *Thistle* is written half length [[file:img/fig1-47.png]].
