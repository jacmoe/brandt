In adapting to English the /Méthode Sténographie Duployé/ I have endeavoured to retain the admirable simplicity which characterizes both its principles and outlines.

Duployan Shorthand being in such a general use upon the Continent, an adaption of it to English, such, that every sound common to the two languages is represented by the same sign, will at once commend itself to those engaged in commercial correspondence. To a student, the Duployan system offers a unique advantage since it puts within his reach reading matter stenographically represented and therefore with true sound values, in at least ten languages, /inter alia/, German, Italian, French, Portuguese, Turkish, etc.

The system has a large and varied literature and also several newspapers and journals. It has met with remarkable success as an educational factor in elementary schools, which is owing in part, to the fact that it is not burdensome to the memory, as it does not call into its service any of the multitude of bewildering devices such as thickening, lengthening, raising above the line, etc., to add new sounds, or disconnected vowels or worse still the discarding of vowels. In this system every sound is represented so clearly that the transcribing, and even fluent reading of it, is an easy matter.

In the first part a system is offered that will enable any one of average intelligence to write from three to four times as fast as in longhand. I have endeavoured to place within the reach of “the many” a system that, to use a popular phrase, supplies a long felt want, that is to say, a system written and learnt with ease, and, most important of all, capable of being read with ease.

In shorthand examinations the marks for transcription are on an average five times as many as are given for the shorthand. If then for the sake of legibility some little advantage in speed has been sacrificed this will be more than atoned for by the ease with which the pupil will read his notes.

In the second and third part there is explained, for those whose goal is the reporters table, a complete system of abbreviated shorthand.

Part II deals with all common prefixes and suffixes abbreviated forms of common words, together with a novel and simple method of representing the auxiliary verbs. Part III, in a few pages expounds our completed system.

I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the Rev. D.H. Thompson [Stonyhurst] for the help he has given me in framing this adaptation. If it meets with any success it will be owing to my collaborateur’s suggestions. ~November 4th, 1901. C. B.~

* The Phonetic Principle
:properties:
:unnumbered: t
:end:
The letters of the Alphabet serve to indicate not only the sounds of the language but also the etymological differences, the variations of pronunciation, and the exigencies of grammar. Consequently we find that certain letters under varying circumstances, assume the characteristic sounds of other letters. In stenography this cannot happen, for, to each and every sound we have given a sign, which unvaryingly represents that one sound only.

To write phonetically, then, all that is required of us is to catch the sounds uttered and represent them by the signs of the stenographic alphabet, paying no attention to the variations of orthography.

In the word /high/ there are four letters but only two sounds, and these two sounds alone, viz, the aspirate and the diphthong, claim the stenographers attention. There are seven letter in the word /through/ to express three sounds; phonography confines itself to the three sounds.

In ordinary writing the sound /uh/ as in /nut/ is represented by different letters in each of the following words: /much/, /love/, /circle/, /pearl/, /sermon/, /pillar/, /courage/, /blood/. Now in phonography one sign is used for this sound. Again, the pronunciation which we give to the letter /i/ in the alphabet, i.e. the sound it has in /fine/, it altogether different in /fin/ and /first/, Phonography recognizes here three distinct sounds and to each of them allots a sign.

The combination /ch/ has a different rendering in each of the following words /cheap/, /chaise/, /schism/, /scheme/. Phonetically their values are ch-ee-p, sh-ai-z, s-i-s-m, s-k-ee-m.

We distinguish also the varying sounds of /t/ in the following words: /net/, /nation/, /feature/, /hasten/.

These few examples are sufficient to illustrate what we mean by the phonetic principle. There is no need for us to discuss its utility.

We conclude these few fore-words by calling the pupil’s attention to an essential point in our phonetics. Stenographic signs represent sounds. Now, the names of the consonants of our ordinary alphabet are Bee, eF, Gee, eM, eL, ahRe, etc. in other words they have in the majority of cases a sound very different from that which they have in words – for example – /church/ spelt out is: /see-aitch-eu-ahre-see-aitch/. Analyzing the sounds of the word we find that there are but four sounds. Take the first part of the word, viz, /ch/, pronounce it slowly, the sound given is that of the two consonants followed by a short sharp /e/ or /uh/ sound; similarly the final /ch/. It will be found that all other consonants are sounded after this manner. Take for example the /s/ and /p/ in /sermon/ and /person/; they are not /eS/, /Pee/ but /suh/, /puh/, or /se/, /pe/. The consonants in our phonetic alphabet are therefore sounded /Be/, /Fe/, /Le/, /Me/, /Re/, /Te/, etc. or /Buh/, /Fuh/, /Luh/, /Muh/, /Ruh/, /Tuh/, etc. This is of great importance and must always be borne in mind.

If therefore a syllable is formed by this obscure vowel sound added to a consonant, it will be indicated by the consonant sign alone. Thus we phonetically represent the following words /much/, /love/, /pearl/, /cousin/, in this way: M[uh]-CH, L[uh]-V, P[uh]-R-L, K[uh]-S-N.

If however the “uh” is accentuated it may then be indicated by its vowel sign. The vowel “uh” in the beginning of such words as earl, earnest, etc. must be shown.

Any want of clearness in the above explanation will be dispelled by noting the application of it in the following lessons to the numerous examples given.

** Lesson 1 - The Signs of the System
[[file:img/lesson1.png]]

The signs of this System are formed from the two simplest of geometrical figures, namely the Straight Line and the Circle.

The straight line both full length and half length takes the following directions indicated by the arrow: [[file:img/fig1-1.png]]

A large and small circle are used, the latter being about half the size of the former: [[file:img/fig1-2.png]]

These circles are now divided first by a line drawn through them Vertically [[file:img/fig1-3.png]] thereby giving us these four signs: [[file:img/fig1-4.png]]. Next by a line dividing them Horizontally [[file:img/fig1-5.png]] and giving us the following signs: [[file:img/fig1-6.png]] i.e. [[file:img/fig1-7.png]]. And lastly, the circles are cut into quadrants: [[file:img/fig1-8.png]] = [[file:img/fig1-9.png]] = [[file:img/fig1-10.png]]

The following supplementary signs, chiefly used as diacritical or distinguishing marks, are also made use of: a dot [[file:img/fig1-11.png]], a dash [[file:img/fig1-12.png]], and the acute [[file:img/fig1-13.png]], and grave [[file:img/fig1-14.png]] accents.

*** The Consonants formed from the Straight line

| [[file:img/fig1-15.png]] | B [[file:img/fig1-16.png]] | P [[file:img/fig1-17.png]] | drawn straight downwards           |
| [[file:img/fig1-18.png]] | D [[file:img/fig1-19.png]] | T [[file:img/fig1-20.png]] | drawn from left to right           |
| [[file:img/fig1-21.png]] | G [[file:img/fig1-22.png]] | K [[file:img/fig1-23.png]] | drawn obliquely from right to left |
| [[file:img/fig1-24.png]] | V [[file:img/fig1-25.png]] | F [[file:img/fig1-26.png]] | drawn obliquely from left to right |
| [[file:img/fig1-27.png]] | R [[file:img/fig1-28.png]] | L [[file:img/fig1-29.png]] | drawn upwards from left to right   |
Observe that the soft and longer sounds B, D, G, V are expressed by the longer lines whilst their corresponding hard and shorter sounds P, T, K, F are expressed by the shorter ones.

The consonant R has two distinct shades of sound, one hard or trill-sound as in /broil/, /umbrella/; the other is a soft and frequently barely audible sound as in /door/, /fear/, /heart/, this latter may be distinguished from the former by a dash written in the middle of the sign: [[file:img/fig1-30.png]].

*** The Consonants formed from the Semi-circles

| S [[file:img/fig1-31.png]]  | Z [[file:img/fig1-32.png]]                            | drawn from left to right | [[file:img/fig1-33.png]] |
| Sh [[file:img/fig1-34.png]] | Zh [[file:img/fig1-35.png]]                           | drawn from left to right | [[file:img/fig1-36.png]] |
| M [[file:img/fig1-37.png]]  | N [[file:img/fig1-38.png]] & NG [[file:img/fig1-39.png]] | drawn downwards          | [[file:img/fig1-40.png]] |
It will be noticed that the soft sounds Z and ZH as in /zeal/, /as/, /vision/, are distinguished from their corresponding hard sounds by a dot. The difference between the two nasals N and NG is also indicated by a dot.

*** The Consonants CH J TH hard TH soft
The true sound-value of the consonant CH is found in the words /church/, /chariot/, /chess/, etc.

The corresponding soft sound is J as in /jerk/, /giant/, /jest/, etc. CH is formed from two quadrants of a small circle [[file:img/fig1-41.png]] written in the same direction as the sign for K viz [[file:img/fig1-42.png]].

J is written the same way but two quadrants of a large circle are used viz [[file:img/fig1-43.png]].

Since TH is a blending of the sounds of T and D, we write its equivalent phonetic character which is formed from two quadrants of a circle joined together, in the same direction as T and D viz [[file:img/fig1-44.png]] i.e. [[file:img/fig1-45.png]].

The soft sound as in *There* is written full length [[file:img/fig1-46.png]].

The hard sound as in *Thistle* is written half length [[file:img/fig1-47.png]].

*** The Consonants Y and W
*Y*. A small semi-circle in this position [[file:img/fig1-48.png]], written downwards and having a dot above is Y.

*W*. The consonant sound W is represented by a quadrant of large circle traced upwards, on the right hand side of which a dot is placed viz [[file:img/fig1-49.png]]
*** The joining together of consonants
In order to connect two consonants together we add the sign of the second to the termination of the first, writing the compound sign with one stroke without lifting the pen.

*Examples*: /kl/ [[file:img/fig1-50.png]], /lk/ [[file:img/fig1-51.png]], /mt/ [[file:img/fig1-52.png]], /tm/ [[file:img/fig1-53.png]], /sg/ [[file:img/fig1-54.png]], /st/ [[file:img/fig1-55.png]], /gr/ [[file:img/fig1-56.png]], /rg/ [[file:img/fig1-57.png]], /chr/ [[file:img/fig1-58.png]], /rch/ [[file:img/fig1-59.png]], /sd/ [[file:img/fig1-60.png]], /dj/ [[file:img/fig1-61.png]], /jr/ [[file:img/fig1-62.png]], /lp/ [[file:img/fig1-63.png]], /pl/ [[file:img/fig1-64.png]], /thm/ [[file:img/fig1-65.png]], /mth/ [[file:img/fig1-66.png]], /nr/ [[file:img/fig1-67.png]], /rth/ [[file:img/fig1-68.png]], /thr/ [[file:img/fig1-69.png]]

It is better to avoid forming an angle between two consonants, wherever is is optional, as for instance [[file:img/fig1-70.png]], it is more rapidly written thus [[file:img/fig1-71.png]].

*Ex*: /vs/ [[file:img/fig1-72.png]], /rsh/ [[file:img/fig1-73.png]], /md/ [[file:img/fig1-74.png]], /ps/ [[file:img/fig1-75.png]], /dn/ [[file:img/fig1-76.png]], /shp/ [[file:img/fig1-77.png]], /mn/ [[file:img/fig1-78.png]], /nm/ [[file:img/fig1-79.png]].

Note the following somewhat difficult connections: /jm/ [[file:img/fig1-80.png]], /nj/ [[file:img/fig1-81.png]], /njm/ [[file:img/fig1-82.png]], /js/ [[file:img/fig1-83.png]], /gj/ [[file:img/fig1-84.png]].

** Lesson 2 - Vowels 1
[[file:img/lesson2.png]]
*** The vowels AH AW OO UH (short)
|----+---+---+--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------|
| AH | æ | a | as sounded in /gnat/ is represented by a small circle    | [[file:img/fig2-1.png]] |
|----+---+---+--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------|
| AW | ɑː | ä | as sounded in /cod/ is represented by a large circle     | [[file:img/fig2-2.png]] |
|----+---+---+--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------|

|----+---+---+--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------|
| UH | ʌ | ə | as sounded in /nut/ is represented by a dot              | [[file:img/fig2-4.png]] |
|----+---+---+--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------|
*** The joining of vowels and consonants
**** In the beginning of words

Join the vowel in such a way that it is either to the *left* or *below*. The reason for this will appear later. We may tabulate this rule thus:

The vowel goes to the left for [[file:img/fig2-5.png]]

The vowel goes below for [[file:img/fig2-6.png]]
*Ex*: /ag/ [[file:img/fig2-7.png]], /ar/ [[file:img/fig2-8.png]], /ob/ [[file:img/fig2-9.png]], /om/ [[file:img/fig2-10.png]], /at/ [[file:img/fig2-11.png]], /od/ [[file:img/fig2-12.png]], /as/ [[file:img/fig2-13.png]], /us/ [[file:img/fig2-14.png]], /ath/ [[file:img/fig2-15.png]], /oth/ [[file:img/fig2-16.png]], /ang/ [[file:img/fig2-17.png]], /ur/ [[file:img/fig2-18.png]], /ut/ [[file:img/fig2-19.png]], /up/ [[file:img/fig2-20.png]], /ug/ [[file:img/fig2-21.png]], etc.


**** In the body of words

Trace the vowel _outside the angle_ formed by two consonants, viz /f-d/ [[file:img/fig2-22.png]] with a vowel /f-a-d/ [[file:img/fig2-23.png]].

*Ex*: /back/ [[file:img/fig2-24.png]], /dock/ [[file:img/fig2-25.png]], /rob/ [[file:img/fig2-26.png]], /top/ [[file:img/fig2-27.png]], /took/ [[file:img/fig2-28.png]], /foot/ [[file:img/fig2-29.png]], /full/ [[file:img/fig2-30.png]], /pull/ [[file:img/fig2-31.png]], /that/ [[file:img/fig2-32.png]], /sad/ [[file:img/fig2-33.png]], /mask/ [[file:img/fig2-34.png]], /cast/ [[file:img/fig2-35.png]], /charge/ [[file:img/fig2-36.png]], /god/ [[file:img/fig2-37.png]], /good/ [[file:img/fig2-38.png]], /block/ [[file:img/fig2-39.png]], /clock/ [[file:img/fig2-40.png]], etc.

**** At the end of a word

Vowels may be written either above or below, to the right or to the left.

*Ex*: /shadow/ [[file:img/fig2-41.png]], /show/ [[file:img/fig2-42.png]], /to/ [[file:img/fig2-43.png]], /body/ [[file:img/fig2-44.png]], /army/ [[file:img/fig2-45.png]], /know/ [[file:img/fig2-46.png]], /blue/ [[file:img/fig2-47.png]].

*** The vowels AH AW OO O (long)
|----+----+----+------+----------------------|
| AH | ɑː  | ä  | /arm/  | [[file:img/fig2-53.png]] |
|----+----+----+------+----------------------|
| AW | ɔ   | ȯ  | /all/  | [[file:img/fig2-54.png]] |
|----+----+----+------+----------------------|
| OO | uː  | ü  | /food/ | [[file:img/fig2-55.png]] |
|----+----+----+------+----------------------|
| O  | oʊ | ō  | /code/ | [[file:img/fig2-48.png]] |
|----+----+----+------+----------------------|
| UR | ɝː  | ər | /nut/  | [[file:img/fig2-4.png]]  |
|----+----+----+------+----------------------|
**** AH AW OO

These are the long sounds of the short vowels *A AW OO*. We write no new sign for these, we simply place over the short vowel sign a horizontal dash that is commonly used to denote a long sound.

*N.B.* /The dashes may, in practice, be omitted as the context will usually supply their omission. Such signs are necessary, however, in cases where any uncertainty may arise./

*Ex*: /awl, all/ [[file:img/fig2-56.png]], /bawl/ [[file:img/fig2-57.png]], /dawn/ [[file:img/fig2-58.png]], /walk/ [[file:img/fig2-59.png]], /caught/ [[file:img/fig2-60.png]], /bought/ [[file:img/fig2-61.png]], /lawn/ [[file:img/fig2-62.png]], /fought/ [[file:img/fig2-63.png]], /laugh/ [[file:img/fig2-64.png]], /palm/ [[file:img/fig2-65.png]], /jar/ [[file:img/fig2-66.png]], /art/ [[file:img/fig2-67.png]], /farm/ [[file:img/fig2-68.png]], /star/ [[file:img/fig2-69.png]], /father/ [[file:img/fig2-70.png]], /arm/ [[file:img/fig2-71.png]], /food/ [[file:img/fig2-72.png]], /flute/ [[file:img/fig2-73.png]], /prove/ [[file:img/fig2-74.png]], /fool/ [[file:img/fig2-75.png]], /poor/ [[file:img/fig2-76.png]], /tooth/ [[file:img/fig2-77.png]], /room/ [[file:img/fig2-78.png]], /suit/ [[file:img/fig2-79.png]], /tool/ [[file:img/fig2-80.png]].


**** O

** Lesson 3 - Vowels 2
[[file:img/lesson3.png]]
*** The vowels EH and EE
|----+---+---+------+---------------------|
| EH | ɛ  | e | /net/  | [[file:img/fig3-1.png]] |
|----+---+---+------+---------------------|
| EE | ɪ  | i | /knit/ | [[file:img/fig3-2.png]] |
|----+---+---+------+---------------------|
The short vowel /EH/ as sounded in /net/ and /let/ is represented by any one of the four small semicircles [[file:img/fig3-1.png]].

For the short vowel /EE/, as in /knit/, /give/, the same signs are used but with the addition of a small dot placed above them [[file:img/fig3-2.png]].

*** The method of joining these signs to others
It is important to clearly understand and faithfully follow this rule, viz. /“In joining these signs to others you must _avoid_ in so doing _forming an angle_. From a consonant to a vowel an angle must never be formed. Nor from a vowel to a consonant, when at the beginning of a word.”/

In the body of a word there will be an angle sometimes, from a vowel to a consonant, but *never* from a consonant to a vowel.

The following examples will illustrate this rule.

**** When a word begins with a vowel

Begin with the little semi-circle and place the consonant-sign that follows, to the right or above, in accordance with the rule enunciated in Lesson 2, 2, a.

*Ex*: /echo/ [[file:img/fig3-3.png]], /ebb/ [[file:img/fig3-4.png]], /elm/ [[file:img/fig3-5.png]], /elbow/ [[file:img/fig3-6.png]], /if/ [[file:img/fig3-7.png]], /it/ [[file:img/fig3-8.png]], /is/ [[file:img/fig3-9.png]], /ill/ [[file:img/fig3-10.png]], /elk/ [[file:img/fig3-11.png]], /elf/ [[file:img/fig3-12.png]], /effort/ [[file:img/fig3-13.png]], /error/ [[file:img/fig3-14.png]], /Italy/ [[file:img/fig3-15.png]], /idiot/ [[file:img/fig3-16.png]], /essay/ [[file:img/fig3-17.png]], /ember/ [[file:img/fig3-18.png]], /else/ [[file:img/fig3-19.png]], /ell/ [[file:img/fig3-20.png]], /egg/ [[file:img/fig3-21.png]], /embark/ [[file:img/fig3-22.png]], /ignore/ [[file:img/fig3-23.png]], /imp/ [[file:img/fig3-24.png]], /etch/ [[file:img/fig3-25.png]], /livery/ [[file:img/fig3-26.png]], /irritable/ [[file:img/fig3-27.png]], /image/ [[file:img/fig3-28.png]], etc.

Of the for equivalent signs [[file:img/fig3-29.png]] choose the one that can be used without forming an angle, e.g. in joining ‘e’ to ‘b’ if forms an angle, viz [[file:img/fig3-30.png]]; nor no. 2 [[file:img/fig3-31.png]], or no. 4 [[file:img/fig3-32.png]]; but with no. 3 there is no angle formed: [[file:img/fig3-33.png]].


**** From a consonant to a vowel

Choose the semi-circle that will not form an angle with the consonant-sign.

*Ex*: /bill/ [[file:img/fig3-34.png]], /bell/ [[file:img/fig3-35.png]], /sell/ [[file:img/fig3-36.png]], /sill/ [[file:img/fig3-37.png]], /mill/ [[file:img/fig3-38.png]], /melt/ [[file:img/fig3-39.png]], /effect/ [[file:img/fig3-40.png]], /this/ [[file:img/fig3-41.png]], /else/ [[file:img/fig3-42.png]], /ell/ [[file:img/fig3-43.png]], /elder/ [[file:img/fig3-44.png]], /egg/ [[file:img/fig3-45.png]], /best/ [[file:img/fig3-46.png]], /practice/ [[file:img/fig3-47.png]], /tell/ [[file:img/fig3-48.png]], /till/ [[file:img/fig3-49.png]], /chest/ [[file:img/fig3-50.png]], /dip/ [[file:img/fig3-51.png]], /rip/ [[file:img/fig3-52.png]], /cellar/ [[file:img/fig3-53.png]], /fellow/ [[file:img/fig3-54.png]], /bellow/ [[file:img/fig3-55.png]], /below/ [[file:img/fig3-56.png]], /jest/ [[file:img/fig3-57.png]], /skip/ [[file:img/fig3-58.png]], /whip/ [[file:img/fig3-59.png]], /rest/ [[file:img/fig3-60.png]], /mistress/ [[file:img/fig3-61.png]], /nest/ [[file:img/fig3-62.png]], /get/ [[file:img/fig3-63.png]], /give/ [[file:img/fig3-64.png]], /jet/ [[file:img/fig3-65.png]], /gelid/ [[file:img/fig3-66.png]], /people/ [[file:img/fig3-67.png]].

*** The vowels EY and EE
|----+---+---+-------+---|
| EY | eɪ | ā | /eight/ |   |
|----+---+---+-------+---|
| EE | iː | ē | /deep/  |   |
|----+---+---+-------+---|
These are the long vowels corresponding to the short vowels /EH/ and /I/. The outline figure is the same in both cases, but /EH/ is distinguished from /EY/ by the latter having a dot placed under it, e.g. /EH/ [[file:img/fig3-68.png]], /EY/ [[file:img/fig3-69.png]].

Also, /EE/ is distinguished from /long EE/ by the latter having the horizontal dash placed above it, e.g. /EE/ [[file:img/fig3-70.png]], /long EE/ [[file:img/fig3-71.png]].

*Ex*: /eight/ [[file:img/fig3-72.png]], /late/ [[file:img/fig3-73.png]], /place/ [[file:img/fig3-74.png]], /maid/ [[file:img/fig3-75.png]], /afraid/ [[file:img/fig3-76.png]], /mislaid/ [[file:img/fig3-77.png]], /plate/ [[file:img/fig3-78.png]], /age/ [[file:img/fig3-79.png]], /chamber/ [[file:img/fig3-80.png]], /brief/ [[file:img/fig3-81.png]], /deep/ [[file:img/fig3-82.png]], /steep/ [[file:img/fig3-83.png]], /meat, meet/ [[file:img/fig3-84.png]], /feature/ [[file:img/fig3-85.png]], /leader/ [[file:img/fig3-86.png]], /seem/ [[file:img/fig3-87.png]], /believe/ [[file:img/fig3-88.png]], /green/ [[file:img/fig3-89.png]], /vain/ [[file:img/fig3-90.png]], /air/ [[file:img/fig3-91.png]], /see/ [[file:img/fig3-92.png]], /say/ [[file:img/fig3-93.png]], /thee/ [[file:img/fig3-94.png]].


*N.B.* The consonant /Y/ is always represented by the small semi-circle but drawn downwards: [[file:img/fig3-95.png]].

*Ex*: /year/ [[file:img/fig3-96.png]], /yard/ [[file:img/fig3-97.png]], /yoke/ [[file:img/fig3-98.png]], /Yorkshire/ [[file:img/fig3-99.png]], /yacht/ [[file:img/fig3-100.png]], /young/ [[file:img/fig3-101.png]], /yellow/ [[file:img/fig3-102.png]], /yawn/ [[file:img/fig3-103.png]], /yet/ [[file:img/fig3-104.png]], /yield/ [[file:img/fig3-105.png]], /yearn/ [[file:img/fig3-106.png]], /youth/ [[file:img/fig3-107.png]].

** Lesson 4 - Diphthongs
[[file:img/lesson4.png]]
*** The diphthong AI
The diphthong /AI/ (aɪ ī) as sounded in /file/ and /my/ is represented by the same sign-outline as that employed to express the vowels /EH/ and /I/, but it is differentiated from these latter by the method of writing it to the other signs.

The rule laid down in Lesson 3-2 is here disregarded and exactly the opposite made use of, i.e. express the diphthong /AI/ by making the semi-circle form an angle.

*Ex*: /tie/ [[file:img/fig4-1.png]], /thigh/ [[file:img/fig4-2.png]], /time/ [[file:img/fig4-3.png]], /mile/ [[file:img/fig4-4.png]], /file/ [[file:img/fig4-5.png]], /fine/ [[file:img/fig4-6.png]], /line/ [[file:img/fig4-7.png]], /like/ [[file:img/fig4-8.png]], /sigh/ [[file:img/fig4-9.png]], /pie/ [[file:img/fig4-10.png]], /right/ [[file:img/fig4-11.png]], /while/ [[file:img/fig4-12.png]], /choir/ [[file:img/fig4-13.png]], /blithe/ [[file:img/fig4-14.png]], /my/ [[file:img/fig4-15.png]].
*** The diphthong AU
The diphthong /AU/ (aʊ au) as sounded in /fowl/ and /cow/ is expressed by combining the two signs representing /AH/ [[file:img/fig4-16.png]] and /OO/ [[file:img/fig4-17.png]] thus [[file:img/fig4-18.png]].

The formation of this sign both at the beginning and end of words, offers no difficulty. When it comes between two consonants the simplest and quickest way of writing it, is to trace it in the same direction as the following sign.

*Ex*: /out/ [[file:img/fig4-19.png]], /hour/ [[file:img/fig4-20.png]], /ounce/ [[file:img/fig4-21.png]], /cow/ [[file:img/fig4-22.png]], /now/ [[file:img/fig4-23.png]], /plough/ [[file:img/fig4-24.png]], /bow/ [[file:img/fig4-25.png]], /about/ [[file:img/fig4-26.png]], /fowl/ [[file:img/fig4-27.png]], /mouse/ [[file:img/fig4-28.png]], /crowd/ [[file:img/fig4-29.png]], /gout/ [[file:img/fig4-30.png]], /growl/ [[file:img/fig4-31.png]], /gown/ [[file:img/fig4-32.png]], /mouth/ [[file:img/fig4-33.png]], /spouse/ [[file:img/fig4-34.png]], /rouse/ [[file:img/fig4-35.png]], /spout/ [[file:img/fig4-36.png]].
*** The diphthong OI
This diphthong (ɔɪ ȯi) is formed by combining the vowel-signs /OH/ and /EE/, viz. [[file:img/fig4-37.png]] or [[file:img/fig4-38-a.png]] or [[file:img/fig4-38-b.png]].

*Ex*: /boil/ [[file:img/fig4-39.png]], /toil/ [[file:img/fig4-40.png]], /joy/ [[file:img/fig4-41.png]], /noise/ [[file:img/fig4-42.png]] or [[file:img/fig4-43.png]], /boy/ [[file:img/fig4-44.png]], /point/ [[file:img/fig4-45.png]], /coin/ [[file:img/fig4-46.png]], /toy/ [[file:img/fig4-47.png]].
*** The diphthong JU
The phonetic /U/ (JU juː), as sounded in /use/ and /view/, is represented by a quadrant of a large circle: [[file:img/fig4-48.png]]. Avoid an angular union wherever possible.

*Ex*: /use/ [[file:img/fig4-49.png]], /music/ [[file:img/fig4-50.png]], /view/ [[file:img/fig4-51.png]], /knew/ [[file:img/fig4-52.png]], /obscure/ [[file:img/fig4-53.png]], /pure/ [[file:img/fig4-54.png]], /duke/ [[file:img/fig4-55.png]].

*N.B.* The consonant /W/ likewise, represented by [[file:img/fig4-56.png]], is always written *upwards*.

*Ex*: /wish/ [[file:img/fig4-57.png]], /with/ [[file:img/fig4-58.png]], /wig/ [[file:img/fig4-59.png]], /wife/ [[file:img/fig4-60.png]], /we/ [[file:img/fig4-61.png]].

** Lesson 5 - Nasals
[[file:img/lesson5.png]]

The sounds /AN ON EN IN UN/ are such as are found in /pan/, /pond/, /pen/, /pin/, and /pun/. They are combinations of the short vowels /a/, /o/, /e/, /i/, and /u/, with the nasal /n/.

If, however, such combinations produce _long sounds_ such as /mane/, /bone/, /green/, /soon/, the above remarks do not apply.

The short nasal sounds /an, on, en, in, un/ are of such frequent occurrence that both speed and legibility is gained by expressing them by a short, simple sign.

They are then always represented by anyone of the four quadrants of a small circle, viz. [[file:img/fig5-1.png]]. The rule laid down in Lesson 3-2 about the method of joining vowels must also be observed here.

In order to distinguish the signs for these various nasal sounds we make use of an acute and grave accent, written either above or below the quadrant.

The following table will illustrate the method of writing them.
| AN | [[file:img/fig5-2.png]] | with an Acute above. |
| ON | [[file:img/fig5-3.png]] | with an Acute below. |
| EN | [[file:img/fig5-4.png]] | without any accent.  |
| IN | [[file:img/fig5-5.png]] | with a Grave above.  |
| UN | [[file:img/fig5-6.png]] | with a Grave below.  |

*Ex*: /done/ [[file:img/fig5-7.png]], /son/ [[file:img/fig5-8.png]], /print/ [[file:img/fig5-9.png]], /sent/ [[file:img/fig5-10.png]], /dent/ [[file:img/fig5-11.png]], /grant/ [[file:img/fig5-12.png]], /month/ [[file:img/fig5-13.png]], /money/ [[file:img/fig5-14.png]], /funny/ [[file:img/fig5-15.png]], /tenth/ [[file:img/fig5-16.png]], /thin/ [[file:img/fig5-17.png]], /front/ [[file:img/fig5-18.png]], /channel/ [[file:img/fig5-19.png]], /chance/ [[file:img/fig5-20.png]], /man/ [[file:img/fig5-21.png]], /men/ [[file:img/fig5-22.png]], /until/ [[file:img/fig5-23.png]], /lunch/ [[file:img/fig5-24.png]], /many/ [[file:img/fig5-25.png]], /none/ [[file:img/fig5-26.png]], /sentry/ [[file:img/fig5-27.png]], /sponge/ [[file:img/fig5-28.png]], /woman/ [[file:img/fig5-29.png]], /women/ [[file:img/fig5-30.png]], /land/ [[file:img/fig5-31.png]], /Sunday/ [[file:img/fig5-32.png]], /winter/ [[file:img/fig5-33.png]], /appearance/ [[file:img/fig5-34.png]], /phonography/ [[file:img/fig5-35.png]], /bondage/ [[file:img/fig5-36.png]], /fancy/ [[file:img/fig5-37.png]], /condense/ [[file:img/fig5-38.png]], /pontiff/ [[file:img/fig5-39.png]].

*N.B.* When the nasal /n/ is preceded by the long vowel sounds /AH/, /AW/, /OO/, /O/, /EY/, /EE/, it must be written out in full.

*Ex*: /moon/ [[file:img/fig5-40.png]], /brain/ [[file:img/fig5-41.png]], /dean/ [[file:img/fig5-42.png]], /pain/ [[file:img/fig5-43.png]], /mean/ [[file:img/fig5-44.png]], /groan/ [[file:img/fig5-45.png]], /stone/ [[file:img/fig5-46.png]], /own/ [[file:img/fig5-47.png]], /stain/ [[file:img/fig5-48.png]], /lawn/ [[file:img/fig5-49.png]], /pawn/ [[file:img/fig5-50.png]], /meanful/ [[file:img/fig5-51.png]], /known/ [[file:img/fig5-52.png]], /soon/ [[file:img/fig5-53.png]], /fawn/ [[file:img/fig5-54.png]], /painter/ [[file:img/fig5-55.png]].

** Lesson 6 - H Aspirate
[[file:img/lesson6.png]]
*** At the beginning of a word
Vowel signs, diphthongs, and the short nasal sounds may be joined to a following consonant sign at the beginning of a word in one of two ways, viz. either by being written forwards or backwards (See Lesson 2-2 and 3-1).

They are written forwards for [[file:img/fig6-1.png]].

They are written backwards for [[file:img/fig6-2.png]].

Now, to show an aspiration at the beginning of words write the vowel in the opposite way, that is to say, if “at” is written thus [[file:img/fig6-3.png]], then by transposing the vowel in this way [[file:img/fig6-4.png]], the “H” aspirate (“hat”) is indicated. Therefore, trace upwards or forwards for a simple vowel, downwards or backwards for an aspirate.

*Ex*: /at/ [[file:img/fig6-5.png]], /hat/ [[file:img/fig6-6.png]], /all/ [[file:img/fig6-7.png]], /hall/ [[file:img/fig6-8.png]], /it/ [[file:img/fig6-9.png]], /hit/ [[file:img/fig6-10.png]], /is/ [[file:img/fig6-11.png]], /his/ [[file:img/fig6-12.png]], /as/ [[file:img/fig6-13.png]], /has/ [[file:img/fig6-14.png]], /air/ [[file:img/fig6-15.png]], /hair/ [[file:img/fig6-16.png]], /and/ [[file:img/fig6-17.png]], /hand/ [[file:img/fig6-18.png]], /ale/ [[file:img/fig6-19.png]], /hale/ [[file:img/fig6-20.png]], /arrow/ [[file:img/fig6-21.png]], /harrow/ [[file:img/fig6-22.png]], /aft/ [[file:img/fig6-23.png]], /haft/ [[file:img/fig6-24.png]], /am/ [[file:img/fig6-25.png]], /ham/ [[file:img/fig6-26.png]], /altar/ [[file:img/fig6-27.png]], /halter/ [[file:img/fig6-28.png]], /ark/ [[file:img/fig6-29.png]], /hark/ [[file:img/fig6-30.png]], /arm/ [[file:img/fig6-31.png]], /harm/ [[file:img/fig6-32.png]], /earl/ [[file:img/fig6-33.png]], /hurl/ [[file:img/fig6-34.png]] or [[file:img/fig6-35.png]] & [[file:img/fig6-36.png]], /art/ [[file:img/fig6-37.png]], /heart/ [[file:img/fig6-38.png]], /eel/ [[file:img/fig6-39.png]], /heel/ [[file:img/fig6-40.png]], /eve/ [[file:img/fig6-41.png]], /heave/ [[file:img/fig6-42.png]], /edge/ [[file:img/fig6-43.png]], /hedge/ [[file:img/fig6-44.png]], /elm/ [[file:img/fig6-45.png]], /helm/ [[file:img/fig6-46.png]], /ire/ [[file:img/fig6-47.png]], /hire/ [[file:img/fig6-48.png]], /old/ [[file:img/fig6-49.png]], /hold/ [[file:img/fig6-50.png]].

*** In the body of a word
When “H” aspirate is sounded in the body of a word, if it is a compound word as “overheard”, we may write separately the two words “over” & “heard” and indicate the aspirate in the latter word, in the manner described in no. 1. In order to show that the two signs represent one word they must be written close together.

*Ex*: /tender-hearted/ [[file:img/fig6-51.png]], /overhang/ [[file:img/fig6-52.png]], /warehouse/ [[file:img/fig6-53.png]], /shorthand/ [[file:img/fig6-54.png]], /Stonyhurst/ [[file:img/fig6-55.png]], /loophole/ [[file:img/fig6-56.png]], /underhand/ [[file:img/fig6-57-a.png]], /upheave/ [[file:img/fig6-57-b.png]]
*** Rule for non-compounded words and aspirated vowel-words
The position of the aspirate in words which are not compounded, e.g. /behalf/ or /enhance/, or in aspirated vowel-words, e.g. /how/ or /who/, is indicated by a short horizontal dash written below the vowel.

*Ex*: /behalf/ [[file:img/fig6-58.png]], /behind/ [[file:img/fig6-59.png]], /enhance/ [[file:img/fig6-60.png]], /who/ [[file:img/fig6-61.png]], /high/ [[file:img/fig6-62.png]], /how/ [[file:img/fig6-63.png]], /apprehension/ [[file:img/fig6-64.png]].

** Lesson 7 - More on nasals
[[file:img/lesson7.png]]
*** Nasal followed by G
When the short nasal sounds are followed by “G” the pronunciation of the syllables will not be /an + g/, /on + g/, etc., but /a + ng/, /o + ng/, etc. Add therefore the short vowel sign to the consonant sign /ng/.

*Ex*: /song/ X, /single/ X, /angle/ X, /lasting/ X, /bring/ X, /flung/ X, /bangle/ X, /sing/ X, /wrangle/ X, /long/ X, /thing/ X.
*** NK
The sound “NK” is made up of /ng/ + /k/ : X + X and is stenographically expressed by adding the “K” sign to “ng”: X.

*Ex*: /bank/ X, /sank/ X, /brink/ X, /ink/ X, /wrinkle/ X, /link/ X, /wink/ X, /sink/ X.

*N.B.* Although it is phonetically incorrect to express the sounds /ank/, /ink/, etc. by adding the “K” sign to the short nasal sign still it may be used as an abbreviated form of the sounds.

*Ex*: /bank/ X, /sank/ X, /brink/ X, /ink/ X, /wrinkle/ X, /link/ X, /wink/ X, /sink/ X.
*** Single vowels or nasal sounds
Words expressed by single vowel or nasal sounds are always represented by the sign appropriate to each in the synoptical vowel table.

*Ex*: /I, eye/ X, /high/ X, /he/ X, /eh/ X, /an/ X, /on/ X, /in/ X, /hen/ X, /you/ X, /hew/ X.

** Note on Part II
By means of the system explained in this elementary course, every word in the English language can be written without difficulty. Those, however, who have desired primarily a very rapid and brief method of writing, will find in the legibility of this system and the ease in acquiring it, a compensation for the want of elegance resulting from the long form of some of the stenographic word-signs. For those, however, who desire a more rapid system of writing we have drawn up in Part II a method of abbreviating which is at the same time easily acquired, written with facility, very legible and proved to give excellent results.

** A Psalm of Life
| Tell | me   | not  | in   | mournful | numbers,  | Life     | is  | but    | an  | empty | dream! |      |       |
| X    | X    | X    | X    | X        | X         | X        | X   | X      | X   | X     | X      |      |       |
| For  | the  | soul | is   | dead     | that      | slumbers | and | things | are | not   | what   | they | seem. |
| X    | X    | X    | X    | X        | X         | X        | X   | X      | X   | X     | X      | X    | X     |
| Life | is   | real | life | is       | earnest   | and      | the | grave  | is  | not   | its    | goal | :     |
| Dust | thou | art  | to   | dust     | returnest | was      | not | spoken | of  | the   | soul   |      |       |
| X    | X    | X    | X    | X        | X         | X        | X   | X      | X   | X     | X      |      |       |
