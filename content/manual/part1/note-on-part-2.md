## Note on Part II {#note-on-part-ii}

By means of the system explained in this elementary course, every word in the English language can be written without difficulty. Those, however, who have desired primarily a very rapid and brief method of writing, will find in the legibility of this system and the ease in acquiring it, a compensation for the want of elegance resulting from the long form of some of the stenographic word-signs. For those, however, who desire a more rapid system of writing we have drawn up in Part II a method of abbreviating which is at the same time easily acquired, written with facility, very legible and proved to give excellent results.
