The letters of the Alphabet serve to indicate not only the sounds of the language but also the etymological differences, the variations of pronunciation, and the exigencies of grammar. Consequently we find that certain letters under varying circumstances, assume the characteristic sounds of other letters. In stenography this cannot happen, for, to each and every sound we have given a sign, which unvaryingly represents that one sound only.

To write phonetically, then, all that is required of us is to catch the sounds uttered and represent them by the signs of the stenographic alphabet, paying no attention to the variations of orthography.

In the word _high_ there are four letters but only two sounds, and these two sounds alone, viz, the aspirate and the diphthong, claim the stenographers attention. There are seven letter in the word _through_ to express three sounds; phonography confines itself to the three sounds.

In ordinary writing the sound _uh_ as in _nut_ is represented by different letters in each of the following words: _much_, _love_, _circle_, _pearl_, _sermon_, _pillar_, _courage_, _blood_. Now in phonography one sign is used for this sound. Again, the pronunciation which we give to the letter _i_ in the alphabet, i.e. the sound it has in _fine_, it altogether different in _fin_ and _first_, Phonography recognizes here three distinct sounds and to each of them allots a sign.

The combination _ch_ has a different rendering in each of the following words _cheap_, _chaise_, _schism_, _scheme_. Phonetically their values are ch-ee-p, sh-ai-z, s-i-s-m, s-k-ee-m.

We distinguish also the varying sounds of _t_ in the following words: _net_, _nation_, _feature_, _hasten_.

These few examples are sufficient to illustrate what we mean by the phonetic principle. There is no need for us to discuss its utility.

We conclude these few fore-words by calling the pupil’s attention to an essential point in our phonetics. Stenographic signs represent sounds. Now, the names of the consonants of our ordinary alphabet are Bee, eF, Gee, eM, eL, ahRe, etc. in other words they have in the majority of cases a sound very different from that which they have in words – for example – _church_ spelt out is: _see-aitch-eu-ahre-see-aitch_. Analyzing the sounds of the word we find that there are but four sounds. Take the first part of the word, viz, _ch_, pronounce it slowly, the sound given is that of the two consonants followed by a short sharp _e_ or _uh_ sound; similarly the final _ch_. It will be found that all other consonants are sounded after this manner. Take for example the _s_ and _p_ in _sermon_ and _person_; they are not _eS_, _Pee_ but _suh_, _puh_, or _se_, _pe_. The consonants in our phonetic alphabet are therefore sounded _Be_, _Fe_, _Le_, _Me_, _Re_, _Te_, etc. or _Buh_, _Fuh_, _Luh_, _Muh_, _Ruh_, _Tuh_, etc. This is of great importance and must always be borne in mind.

If therefore a syllable is formed by this obscure vowel sound added to a consonant, it will be indicated by the consonant sign alone. Thus we phonetically represent the following words _much_, _love_, _pearl_, _cousin_, in this way: M[uh]-CH, L[uh]-V, P[uh]-R-L, K[uh]-S-N.

If however the “uh” is accentuated it may then be indicated by its vowel sign. The vowel “uh” in the beginning of such words as earl, earnest, etc. must be shown.

Any want of clearness in the above explanation will be dispelled by noting the application of it in the following lessons to the numerous examples given.
