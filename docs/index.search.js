    "content": "In adapting to English the Méthode Sténographie Duployé I have endeavoured to retain the admirable simplicity which characterizes both its principles and outlines.\nDuployan Shorthand being in such a general use upon the Continent, an adaption of it to English, such, that every sound common to the two languages is represented by the same sign, will at once commend itself to those engaged in commercial correspondence. To a student, the Duployan system offers a unique advantage since it puts within his reach reading matter stenographically represented and therefore with true sound values, in at least ten languages, inter alia, German, Italian, French, Portuguese, Turkish, etc.\nThe system has a large and varied literature and also several newspapers and journals. It has met with remarkable success as an educational factor in elementary schools, which is owing in part, to the fact that it is not burdensome to the memory, as it does not call into its service any of the multitude of bewildering devices such as thickening, lengthening, raising above the line, etc., to add new sounds, or disconnected vowels or worse still the discarding of vowels. In this system every sound is represented so clearly that the transcribing, and even fluent reading of it, is an easy matter.\nIn the first part a system is offered that will enable any one of average intelligence to write from three to four times as fast as in longhand. I have endeavoured to place within the reach of “the many” a system that, to use a popular phrase, supplies a long felt want, that is to say, a system written and learnt with ease, and, most important of all, capable of being read with ease.\nIn shorthand examinations the marks for transcription are on an average five times as many as are given for the shorthand. If then for the sake of legibility some little advantage in speed has been sacrificed this will be more than atoned for by the ease with which the pupil will read his notes.\nIn the second and third part there is explained, for those whose goal is the reporters table, a complete system of abbreviated shorthand.\nPart II deals with all common prefixes and suffixes abbreviated forms of common words, together with a novel and simple method of representing the auxiliary verbs. Part III, in a few pages expounds our completed system.\nI take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the Rev. D.H. Thompson [Stonyhurst] for the help he has given me in framing this adaptation. If it meets with any success it will be owing to my collaborateur’s suggestions. November 4th, 1901. C. B.\n",

    "content": "The letters of the Alphabet serve to indicate not only the sounds of the language but also the etymological differences, the variations of pronunciation, and the exigencies of grammar. Consequently we find that certain letters under varying circumstances, assume the characteristic sounds of other letters. In stenography this cannot happen, for, to each and every sound we have given a sign, which unvaryingly represents that one sound only.\nTo write phonetically, then, all that is required of us is to catch the sounds uttered and represent them by the signs of the stenographic alphabet, paying no attention to the variations of orthography.\nIn the word high there are four letters but only two sounds, and these two sounds alone, viz, the aspirate and the diphthong, claim the stenographers attention. There are seven letter in the word through to express three sounds; phonography confines itself to the three sounds.\nIn ordinary writing the sound uh as in nut is represented by different letters in each of the following words: much, love, circle, pearl, sermon, pillar, courage, blood. Now in phonography one sign is used for this sound. Again, the pronunciation which we give to the letter i in the alphabet, i.e. the sound it has in fine, it altogether different in fin and first, Phonography recognizes here three distinct sounds and to each of them allots a sign.\nThe combination ch has a different rendering in each of the following words cheap, chaise, schism, scheme. Phonetically their values are ch-ee-p, sh-ai-z, s-i-s-m, s-k-ee-m.\nWe distinguish also the varying sounds of t in the following words: net, nation, feature, hasten.\nThese few examples are sufficient to illustrate what we mean by the phonetic principle. There is no need for us to discuss its utility.\nWe conclude these few fore-words by calling the pupil’s attention to an essential point in our phonetics. Stenographic signs represent sounds. Now, the names of the consonants of our ordinary alphabet are Bee, eF, Gee, eM, eL, ahRe, etc. in other words they have in the majority of cases a sound very different from that which they have in words – for example – church spelt out is: see-aitch-eu-ahre-see-aitch. Analyzing the sounds of the word we find that there are but four sounds. Take the first part of the word, viz, ch, pronounce it slowly, the sound given is that of the two consonants followed by a short sharp e or uh sound; similarly the final ch. It will be found that all other consonants are sounded after this manner. Take for example the s and p in sermon and person; they are not eS, Pee but suh, puh, or se, pe. The consonants in our phonetic alphabet are therefore sounded Be, Fe, Le, Me, Re, Te, etc. or Buh, Fuh, Luh, Muh, Ruh, Tuh, etc. This is of great importance and must always be borne in mind.\nIf therefore a syllable is formed by this obscure vowel sound added to a consonant, it will be indicated by the consonant sign alone. Thus we phonetically represent the following words much, love, pearl, cousin, in this way: M[uh]-CH, L[uh]-V, P[uh]-R-L, K[uh]-S-N.\nIf however the “uh” is accentuated it may then be indicated by its vowel sign. The vowel “uh” in the beginning of such words as earl, earnest, etc. must be shown.\nAny want of clearness in the above explanation will be dispelled by noting the application of it in the following lessons to the numerous examples given.\n",

Next by a line dividing them Horizontally and giving us the following signs: i.e. . And lastly, the circles are cut into quadrants: = = The following supplementary signs, chiefly used as diacritical or distinguishing marks, are also made use of: a dot , a dash , and the acute , and grave accents.\nThe Consonants formed from the Straight line B P drawn straight downwards D T drawn from left to right G K drawn obliquely from right to left V F drawn obliquely from left to right R L drawn upwards from left to right Observe that the soft and longer sounds B, D, G, V are expressed by the longer lines whilst their corresponding hard and shorter sounds P, T, K, F are expressed by the shorter ones.\nThe consonant R has two distinct shades of sound, one hard or trill-sound as in broil, umbrella; the other is a soft and frequently barely audible sound as in door, fear, heart, this latter may be distinguished from the former by a dash written in the middle of the sign: .\nThe Consonants formed from the Semi-circles S Z drawn from left to right Sh Zh drawn from left to right M N \u0026 NG drawn downwards It will be noticed that the soft sounds Z and ZH as in zeal, as, vision, are distinguished from their corresponding hard sounds by a dot. The difference between the two nasals N and NG is also indicated by a dot.\nThe Consonants CH J TH hard TH soft The true sound-value of the consonant CH is found in the words church, chariot, chess, etc.\nThe corresponding soft sound is J as in jerk, giant, jest, etc. CH is formed from two quadrants of a small circle written in the same direction as the sign for K viz .\nJ is written the same way but two quadrants of a large circle are used viz .\nSince TH is a blending of the sounds of T and D, we write its equivalent phonetic character which is formed from two quadrants of a circle joined together, in the same direction as T and D viz i.e. .\nThe soft sound as in There is written full length .\nThe hard sound as in Thistle is written half length .\nThe Consonants Y and W Y. A small semi-circle in this position , written downwards and having a dot above is Y.\nW. The consonant sound W is represented by a quadrant of large circle traced upwards, on the right hand side of which a dot is placed viz The joining together of consonants In order to connect two consonants together we add the sign of the second to the termination of the first, writing the compound sign with one stroke without lifting the pen.\nExamples: kl , lk , mt , tm , sg , st , gr , rg , chr , rch , sd , dj , jr , lp , pl , thm , mth , nr , rth , thr It is better to avoid forming an angle between two consonants, wherever is is optional, as for instance , it is more rapidly written thus .\nEx: vs , rsh , md , ps , dn , shp , mn , nm .\nNote the following somewhat difficult connections: jm , nj , njm , js , gj .\nConsonants P K CH T TH F L S SH M Y B G J D TH V R R Z ZH N NG W ",

    "content": " Welcome to Brandt’s Duployan.\nThis is an adaptation of the French Duployan shorthand system to English by Carl Brandt, a Jesuit monk, who also did adaptations of Duployan to Danish and to Latin.\nDuployan shorthand is classified as a geometric, alphabetic shorthand, meaning that it is constructed of lines and circles, and it does not feature any shading (thickening of the line).\nDuployan shorthand was created in 1860 by Émile Duployé for writing French, and it most likely the most adapted system of shorthand. There are adaptations for English, Latin, Danish, Romanian, Chinook Wawa, German and Spanish.\nDuployan shorthand has a reputation for being extremely easy to learn, and that is probably why it has been so widely adopted. It was the preferred system of shorthand among missionaries, especially the Jesuits.\nIn the Preface, Brandt writes:\nIn adapting to English the Méthode Sténographie Duployé I have endeavoured to retain the admirable simplicity which characterizes both its principles and outlines.\nIn the first part a system is offered that will enable any one of average intelligence to write from three to four times as fast as in longhand. I have endeavoured to place within the reach of “the many” a system that, to use a popular phrase, supplies a long felt want, that is to say, a system written and learnt with ease, and, most important of all, capable of being read with ease.\nThis is the alphabet of Brandt’s Duployan, taken from the handwritten manual: A review of Brandt’s Duployan, from Brandt Duployan – the best Duployan yet? - Shorthand community on Reddit:\nAbout the system:\nThere are several unique qualities not shared by other adaptations and it is (along with Pernin) the most thorough adaptation (at least based upon what is in the text) that I have looked at.\nConclusion:\nAfter some weeks of use, I think it is fair to say that Brandt’s system has supplanted Perrault’s as my preferred Duployan adaptation. The handling of the Short U vowel, the shortcuts for ER, OUR, OUS, the well thought out and composable affixes and the unique use of position for auxiliary and modal verbs make this a very worthy addition to the list of Duployan adaptations.\nThe original, handwritten manual from 1904 is to be found at Archive.org: Duployan Shorthand adapted to English - 5th Edition, 1904 - Carl Brandt.\nWriting sample from Part 2 of the manual, written in the abbreviated style: ",
