      <description>Lesson 1 - The Signs of the System The signs of this System are formed from the two simplest of geometrical figures, namely the Straight Line and the Circle.
The straight line both full length and half length takes the following directions indicated by the arrow: A large and small circle are used, the latter being about half the size of the former: These circles are now divided first by a line drawn through them Vertically thereby giving us these four signs: .</description>

      <description>Lesson 2 - Vowels 1 The vowels AH AW OO UH (short) AH as sounded in gnat is represented by a small circle AW as sounded in cod is represented by a large circle OO as sounded in foot is represented by a radiated circle UH as sounded in nut is represented by a dot The joining of vowels and consonants In the beginning of words Join the vowel in such a way that it is either to the left or below.</description>

      <description>Lesson 3 - Vowels 2 The vowels EH and EE EH net EE knit The short vowel EH as sounded in net and let is represented by any one of the four small semicircles .
For the short vowel EE, as in knit, give, the same signs are used but with the addition of a small dot placed above them .
The method of joining these signs to others It is important to clearly understand and faithfully follow this rule, viz.</description>

      <description>Lesson 4 - Diphthongs The diphthong AI The diphthong AI ( ) as sounded in file and my is represented by the same sign-outline as that employed to express the vowels EH and I, but it is differentiated from these latter by the method of writing it to the other signs.
The rule laid down in Lesson 3-2 is here disregarded and exactly the opposite made use of, i.e. express the diphthong AI by making the semi-circle form an angle.</description>

      <title>Lesson 5 - Nasals</title>

      <description>Lesson 5 - Nasals The sounds AN ON EN IN UN are such as are found in pan, pond, pen, pin, and pun. They are combinations of the short vowels a, o, e, i, and u, with the nasal n.
If, however, such combinations produce long sounds such as mane, bone, green, soon, the above remarks do not apply.
The short nasal sounds an, on, en, in, un are of such frequent occurrence that both speed and legibility is gained by expressing them by a short, simple sign.</description>

      <description>Lesson 6 - H Aspirate At the beginning of a word Vowel signs, diphthongs, and the short nasal sounds may be joined to a following consonant sign at the beginning of a word in one of two ways, viz. either by being written forwards or backwards (See Lesson 2-2 and 3-1).
They are written forwards for .
They are written backwards for .
Now, to show an aspiration at the beginning of words write the vowel in the opposite way, that is to say, if “at” is written thus , then by transposing the vowel in this way , the “H” aspirate (“hat”) is indicated.</description>

      <description>Lesson 7 - More on nasals Nasal followed by G When the short nasal sounds are followed by “G” the pronunciation of the syllables will not be an + g, on + g, etc., but a + ng, o + ng, etc. Add therefore the short vowel sign to the consonant sign ng.
Ex: song , single , angle , lasting , bring , flung , bangle , sing , wrangle , long , thing .</description>

      <description>Note on Part II By means of the system explained in this elementary course, every word in the English language can be written without difficulty. Those, however, who have desired primarily a very rapid and brief method of writing, will find in the legibility of this system and the ease in acquiring it, a compensation for the want of elegance resulting from the long form of some of the stenographic word-signs.</description>

      <description>A Psalm of Life Tell me not in mournful numbers, “Life is but an empty dream!” For the soul is dead that slumbers, and things are not what they seem. Life is real life is earnest and the grave is not its goal: “Dust thou art to dust returnest” was not spoken of the soul Not enjoyment and not sorrow, is our destined end or way But to act, that each to-morrow finds us further than to-day.</description>
